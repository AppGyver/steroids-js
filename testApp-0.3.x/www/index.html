  <h1>Hello world!</h1>

  <p>This file is located in <code>www/index.html</code> and it's also missing a proper layout and CSS. If you have an existing PhoneGap project you can place it in <code>www/</code>.  But wait until you see what it means to put your project <em>on Steroids</em>.</p>

  <strong>Let's do that!</strong>

  <p>Edit <code>config/application.coffee</code> to enable tabs by uncommenting few preconfigured lines:
    <code>Steroids.config.tabBar.enabled</code> and <code>Steroids.config.tabBar.tabs</code> and the array that defines the tabs.</p>

  <p>Then, do a <code>$ steroids push</code> while <code>$ steroids connect</code> is still running and this will get more interesting.</p>
