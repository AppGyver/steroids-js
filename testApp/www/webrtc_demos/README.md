# WebRTC code samples #

This is a repository for the WebRTC Javascript code samples.

Some of the samples use new browser features. They may only work in Chrome Canary and/or Firefox Beta, and may require flags to be set.

All of the samples use [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter), a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences. In fact, the standards and protocols used for WebRTC implementations are highly stable, and there are only a few prefixed names. For full interop information, see [webrtc.org/web-apis/interop](http://www.webrtc.org/web-apis/interop).

In Chrome and Opera, all samples that use `getUserMedia()` must be run from a server. Calling `getUserMedia()` from a file:// URL will work in Firefox, but fail silently in Chrome and Opera.

[webrtc.org/testing](http://www.webrtc.org/testing) lists command line flags useful for development and testing with Chrome.

For more information about WebRTC, we maintain a list of [WebRTC Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idl_NYQhllFEFqkGQOLv8KBK8M3EVzyvxnKkHl4SuM8/edit). If you've never worked with WebRTC, we recommend you start with the 2013 Google I/O [WebRTC presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2HzZkd2A40).
